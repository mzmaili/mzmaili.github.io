## About me
I'm a Product Manager in the Identity and Network Access division within the Customer Experience Engineering team at Microsoft Security, where I work closely with enterprise customers, partners, and engineering team to elevate cybersecurity and identity protection through innovative, cutting-edge solutions.

I work hand in hand with engineering teams to drive continuous improvements in Microsoft Entra products, ensuring they not only address evolving security challenges but also contribute to increasing global security standards. My mission is to help create a safer digital world by advancing identity and access management solutions that safeguard organizations and individuals alike.

With deep expertise in identity management technologies, I specialize in Active Directory, Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), Global Secure Access (Secure Service Edge, Zero Trust Network Access), ADFS, Device Registration, Passwordless authentication, Identity Protection, MFA, and Conditional Access. My proficiency in authentication protocols, including SAML, Kerberos, NTLM, OAuth, and OpenID Connect, enables me to design and implement comprehensive security strategies that streamline operations and fortify infrastructures.

Additionally, I am the author of highly effective troubleshooting tools such as DSRegTool and Test-DeviceRegConnectivity, which have transformed the efficiency of resolving device registration issues. These tools not only accurately diagnose problems but also provide precise recommendations for resolving them. As a result, they have significantly reduced case volumes, enhanced case deflection, and streamlined support operations, contributing to improved customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

As a mentor and career coach, I take pride in nurturing the professional growth of individuals across various roles both inside and outside my organization. By providing technical guidance and career development support, I empower them to achieve excellence and advance their careers.
